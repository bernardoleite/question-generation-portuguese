# Automatic Question Generation & Difficulty Control for the Portuguese Language

<img src="images/webapp_1.jpg" style="width: 15%; height: 15%" align="right" />

## Overview
We present a **tool** capable of automatically **generating questions in Portuguese** with **controlled difficulty**. Our methodology is guided by three different kinds of questions: (A) Grammar, (B) Factoid (*wh-questions*), and (C) Pronoun reference. For the former (A), we have followed a rule-based approach by establishing rules aligned with the Portuguese grammar. For reading comprehension (B), we generate facoid (who-type) questions and, for that, we tested five different methods. The first one performs a syntax-based analysis by using the information obtained from Part-of- speech tagging and Named Entity Recognition. The second carries out a semantic analysis of the sentences, through Semantic Role Labeling. The third method extracts the inherent dependencies within sentences using Dependency Parsing. The fourth takes advantage of the relative pronouns and adverbs found in the sentences. The fifth explores the usefulness and practicality of discourse connectors. Finally, for the last approach (C), we create pronoun reference questions, in which we do not only generate our questions but also the text excerpts they are generated from. We define heuristic functions that assign difficulty values for each question.
